To enter tab scrolling mode, press Shift+Alt. Use the mousewheel to scroll through the tabs. To exit tab scrolling mode, press Shift+Alt+Z. Strictly speaking, you don't have to have Shift+Alt pressed to scroll through tabs after the first time you press it. However, it is more convenient if you do, and makes entering the Shift+Alt+Z command easier.
